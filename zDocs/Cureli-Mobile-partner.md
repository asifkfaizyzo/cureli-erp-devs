The core availability control. Rider manually switches between online and offline.

**Online state:**
- Rider is visible to the assignment system
- Rider can receive order notifications
- Live location tracking begins
- Earnings counter is active

**Offline state:**
- Rider receives no orders
- Location tracking pauses
- Rider can go offline between deliveries or at end of day

**Rules:**

---

### 3.2 Shift System (Optional — for Incentives)

Cureli can define peak-hour shifts with bonus incentives attached.

**How it works:**
- CAdmin defines shifts (e.g. Morning 9am–12pm, Evening 5pm–9pm)
- Shifts are tagged as "bonus eligible"

- Rider opts into a shift by going online within that time window
- If rider completes the minimum required deliveries within the shift window, bonus is credited automatically

**Shift details shown to rider:**
- Shift name and time window
- Minimum deliveries required for bonus
- Bonus amount
- Current progress within shift (e.g. 3 of 5 deliveries done)

---

## PART 4 — ORDER ASSIGNMENT & ACCEPTANCE

### 4.1 Auto-Assignment Logic

When a pharmacy marks an order ready for pickup, the system automatically finds the best available rider.

**Assignment criteria:**
- Rider must be online
- Rider must be in the same zone as the pharmacy
- Rider must not have an active delivery in progress
- Nearest rider (by real-time GPS distance) is assigned first

**Assignment cascade:**
- Nearest available rider is notified first
- If no response within 30 seconds → next nearest rider is notified
- Cascade continues until a rider accepts
- If no rider accepts after X attempts → CAdmin is alerted

---

### 4.2 Order Notification

When assigned, rider receives:
- Push notification (even if app is in background)
- In-app full-screen alert with accept / reject buttons
- 30-second countdown timer
- Audio alert

---

### 4.3 Order Preview (Before Accepting)

Rider sees the following before deciding:

| Info shown | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Pharmacy name | Pickup point |
| Pharmacy address | With map pin |
| Estimated distance to pharmacy | In km |
| Estimated distance pharmacy to customer | In km |
| Estimated total trip distance | In km |
| Estimated earnings for this delivery | In ₹ |
| Estimated time | In minutes |

**What rider does NOT see before accepting:**
- Customer name or phone number
- Order contents or item details
- Customer address (shown only after acceptance)

---

### 4.4 Accept / Reject

- **Accept** → rider is locked into the order, full details revealed
- **Reject** → rider remains online, order cascades to next rider
- **No response in 30 seconds** → treated as reject, order cascades

**Reject reason required:** Rider must select a reason when rejecting (too far / not feeling well / bike issue / other)

**Reject rate monitoring:** High rejection rates are flagged to CAdmin

---
